# soc-elk-siem-lab
Built a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab using the ELK Stack to simulate real-world attack scenarios. Configured Elastic Agent on Windows endpoints to collect Sysmon and Microsoft Defender logs, detection brute-force and malware events, and created Kibana dashboards for real-time threat monitoring.
